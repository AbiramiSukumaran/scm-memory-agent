# Supply Chain Agent with Memory (Vertex AI Memory Bank)

In this codelab, you will build a Supply Chain Orchestrator agent. This application allows users to analyze inventory, track logistics, and manage supply chain risks using natural language.

We will leverage Google's Agent Development Kit (ADK) to build a multi-agent architecture that maintains context, remembers user preferences via Vertex AI Memory Bank, and interacts with a massive dataset stored in AlloyDB via the MCP Toolbox.
